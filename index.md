# Hannah Lee
I pay attention to attention, mostly being the most distracted person in one sitting/setting.

## About Me

I am currently a research assistant at NYU Langone and Columbia NYSPI, where I work on projects exploring the neural basis of visual perception and perceptual decision.

### Research Interests

My research interests focus on the biological foundations of visual perception and attention, particularly how these visual judgments shape decision-making processes. I am especially interested in how different regions within traditional and non-traditional visual pathways contribute to perception, and how they adapt to compensate for damage or loss.
